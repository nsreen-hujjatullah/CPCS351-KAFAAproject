The main problem is the high prices of electricity bill in Saudi Arabia, due to peopleâ€™s 
lack of awareness of the extent of their electricity consumption. Such as forgetting some 
electrical appliances are open without needing them.It makes sense to have an application 
linked to a device installed on the electricity meter at home so that the user's consumption of 
electricity is monitored, which contributes to his awareness to reduce his consumption of it.
